BELOW IS THE FEEDBACK ON MY APPLAB APP:

The feedback I received was relatively the same. 
The two players said that they wished there was more options to choose from 
such as color variation and they wished their answers were more impactful. 
Overall, I felt like this App was a success! I really enjoyed making it and canâ€™t wait to do more.
