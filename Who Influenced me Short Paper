Someone who influenced me growing up was my Mom.
I know its kinda cliche but she is honestly someone who has heavily impacted me growing up.
I remember when I was little I wanted to be exactly like my Mom. She was super nice to everyone so I would do the same.
People seemed to gravitate towards her and always say how amazing she was. I was eager to experience these same scenarios.
Not only was her kind demeanor infectious but her gracious/generous acts were too.
I began to give gifts to my friends on the daily since my Mother would do the same for me and my sister to show her affection for us.
As I have grown up this has become sort of a reality for me and although
Iâ€™d say I am very similar to my mother we both have developed into different people.
I know for a fact I would not be the way I am today without her. She has always been my biggest supporter 
and has always been there for me when the going gets tough. Overall, my mother is the one person who influenced me the most growing up.
